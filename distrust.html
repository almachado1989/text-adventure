            <i>You start to walk away but Rodney grabs your arm. You yank yourself free and start to run. Rodney calls out but you can't make out what he's saying. You look back over your shoulder but as you do, you trip, fall and hear a snap. Lying on the ground with your leg broken, you wonder if you made the wrong choices.</i>
